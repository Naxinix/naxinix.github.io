			<h2><b>Inspiration and Preproduction</b></h2>
			<p>As a huge fan of The Last of Us games, as well as their level design and scenery, I decided to make a level
				in <b>Unreal Engine</b> for its beloved multiplayer mode.<br><br>
				
				In "The Last Of Us Online", two teams of four fight for supplies. So far, there are 3 gamemodes, but the maps are viable for 
				all gamemodes as they don't rely on level structure istelf but on the objectives in it. <br><br>

				Far from other frenetic shooter games, a unique feature of TLOU Online is the importance of stealth, so the maps
				are covered with props and structures to avoid being seen.<br><br>

				Having this in mind, I looked for a suitable asset pack and aimed for a level with great focus on the environment, with slow paced routes and a good amount 
				of covers to give the players places to hide.

			The green squares represent buildings that can actually be crossed through.<br>
			The yellow square represents the central open area of the map, where the two teams are more likely to have fights.<br><br>
			As a way to avoid spawn-camping, each spawn point must have 3 main routes. The first route goes straight to the central zone.
			The second also gives the chance to reach the central area, slower than route one, but with more cover.
			Finally, the third route is a long flanking path that leads to the enemy spawn, and that also connects to the central
			area through an early bifurcation.  <br><br>


			The paths size is carefully measured to spend the same time walking from point A to point B and vice versa.

			<h2><b>Blockout</b></h2>
			In this phase I sat the ground for the composition in the level.<br><br>
			I created BSP on the same scale as the walls in the asset pack and adjusted my blockout to fit it.
			During blockout I also placed BSP that worked as covers, distributed equally on each area. The majority of covers require the player to crouch, while others
			can hide a standing player.<br><br>
			In this stage I also worked on the level composition to distinguish certain elements, such as placing elements near doors, elevated areas or
			at the beginning of potential routes, to guide the player's eye.

			<h2><b>Art pass</b></h2>
			The art pass was really important, as the focus on the environment was one of the 
			key features of this project. <br><br>
			
			I began changing the buildings BSP with the final meshes and establishing.
			Then I also substituted the covers BSP with collidable props that matched the proportions and shape of he BSP.

			The level is divided in two main zones, easily differenced by the type of assets present on each zone. My intention was to 
			quickly know where you are just by looking at the environment around you.
			This way, spawn A is full of brick tall buildings,
			while in spawn B, there are plenty of short white constructions<br><br>
			I also did some prop work that doesn't contribute to the level design itself, but help set the abandonment mood 
			that I'm trying to establish. These include puddles, vegetation, and other non-collidable meshes.
			Finally, I tweaked the world lights to set the level at sunset to match and highlight tone of the bricks, which are
			present all around the map.

			<h2><b>Closing thoughts</b></h2>


			I game myself two weeks to finish the project, from initial idea to completion, and I was able to complete it on time.<br><br> 

			The level is kind of big, but I aimed for giving each area the same amount of detail and polish. 

			I'm also aware that the map doesn't have much verticality, since I was a little constrained by the asset pack. There are, still,
			certain zones in which to gain some height.<br><br>

			Overall, it was a good exercise and I'm happy with the result, as I think it resembles the 
			vibe of actual TLOU multiplayer maps and that was my ultimate goal.
